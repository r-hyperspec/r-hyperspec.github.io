# To-Do List for Package Consistency

Make sure for each repo, to the greatest degree possible:

* Stale branches removed
* Stale issues closed
* Repo description is updated, accurate, consistent
* `NEWS.md` updated
* `README.md` updated (general layout consistent across all packages)
* Default branch is correct
* CI instructions are using the correct branch
* Should the repo have a gh-pages branch?  Is it up-to-date?

If we are "good" along the way, probably much of this is actually done.  `NEWS.md` may need the most work.

* Everyone should be sure they are watching/receiving notifications for all the repos that matter to them.
